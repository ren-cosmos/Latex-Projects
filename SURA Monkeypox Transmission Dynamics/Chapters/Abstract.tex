A monkeypox disease transmission model of SVEIR type with two groups humans and reservoirs and delays in latent and temporary immune period is discussed. A general probability distrubution model is considered for accounting delays and used for proving the boundedness and positivity of solutions. A proof of existence and stability of desease free and endemic equilibrium is discussed for the specific probability distribution with the Reproduction Number. Later, the theoretical findings from stability analysis are verified with some numerical simulations of the specific probability distribution model.
